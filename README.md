# OSS Audit — Git (24BCG10026)

**Student:** Arsh Verma
**Roll Number:** 24BCG10026
**Course:** Open Source Software — CSE0002
**Chosen Software:** Git (Version Control System)
**License:** GNU General Public License v2 (GPL v2)
**Repository:** https://github.com/ArshVermaGit/oss-audit-24BCG10026

## About This Project

This repository houses the capstone audit of **Git** — the world's most widely used distributed version control system — conducted as part of the Open Source Software (OSS NGMC) course. The audit examines Git's origin story, analysis of its GPL v2 licensing, and its technical footprint on Linux systems. Alongside the written report, the project includes five original shell scripts that demonstrate practical Linux command-line and shell scripting skills.

---

## Chosen Software — Git

Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It was born out of a crisis in the Linux kernel community after a proprietary tool (BitKeeper) revoked its free license. This event catalyzed the creation of Git, which has since become the industry standard for collaboration, transparency, and freedom in software development.

## 🛠️ Setup & Configuration

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the project from your terminal.

### 1. Environment Setup
The project is designed for **Linux** environments (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHEL, Fedora). If you are on macOS, the scripts will run but some system-level checks (like `/etc/os-release`) may provide fallback information.

### 2. Dependency Installation
Ensure you have `bash`, `git`, and standard `coreutils` installed.

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y
```

**RHEL / CentOS / Fedora:**
```bash
sudo yum install git -y   # CentOS/RHEL
sudo dnf install git -y   # Fedora
```

### 3. Git Configuration (Optional but Recommended)
For specific auditing scripts to function perfectly, configure your local Git identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 4. Clone & Execution
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ArshVermaGit/oss-audit-24BCG10026.git
cd oss-audit-24BCG10026

# Make all scripts executable (REQUIRED)
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run the project scripts (details below)
./scripts/script1_system_identity.sh
```

## Script Descriptions and How to Run Each

### Script 1 — System Identity Report (`script1_system_identity.sh`)

Displays a formatted welcome screen containing the Linux distribution name, kernel version, logged-in username, home directory path, system uptime, current date and time, and a note about the open-source (GPL v2) licence of the Linux kernel. Demonstrates the use of **variables**, **`echo`**, and **command substitution `$()`**.

**Run:**
```bash
./scripts/script1_system_identity.sh
```
**Expected output:** A bordered banner showing all system identity fields along with a brief note about GPL v2 licensing of the Linux kernel.

---

### Script 2 — FOSS Package Inspector (`script2_package_inspector.sh`)

Checks whether Git is installed on the system, retrieves its version and licence information, and uses a `case` statement to print a philosophy note about each recognised open-source package. Demonstrates **if-then-else**, **case statements**, **`dpkg`/`rpm` queries**, and **piping with `grep`**.

**Run:**
```bash
./scripts/script2_package_inspector.sh
```
**Expected output:** Installation status of Git, its version, licence details, and a one-line open-source philosophy note.

---

### Script 3 — Disk and Permission Auditor (`script3_disk_auditor.sh`)

Loops through key system directories (e.g., `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, `/home`) and reports the permissions, owner, and disk usage for each. Also inspects Git's configuration directory if present. Demonstrates **`for` loops**, **`du`**, **`ls -ld`**, **`awk`**, and **`cut`**.

**Run:**
```bash
./scripts/script3_disk_auditor.sh
```
**Expected output:** A formatted table listing directories alongside their permissions, owners, and sizes.

---

### Script 4 — Log File Analyzer (`script4_log_analyzer.sh`)

Reads a log file line by line, counts how many lines match a user-supplied keyword (default: `"error"`), and prints the last five matching lines. Demonstrates **`while read` loops**, **if-then conditionals**, **counter variables**, and **command-line arguments (`$1`, `$2`)**.

**Run:**
```bash
./scripts/script4_log_analyzer.sh /var/log/syslog error
# or with a custom log file and keyword:
./scripts/script4_log_analyzer.sh /path/to/logfile WARNING
```
**Expected output:** The total count of keyword matches followed by the last five matching lines from the log file.

---

### Script 5 — Open Source Manifesto Generator (`script5_manifesto_generator.sh`)

Interactively asks the user three questions about their open-source beliefs, then generates a personalised philosophy statement and saves it to a `.txt` file. Demonstrates **`read` for user input**, **string concatenation**, **file writing with `>` and `>>`**, and the **`date` command**.

**Run:**
```bash
./scripts/script5_manifesto_generator.sh
```
**Expected output:** A saved file named `manifesto_[username].txt` containing a personalised open-source philosophy paragraph; the same text is also printed to the terminal.

## Notes for the Evaluator

- All scripts have been tested on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.
- **Script 4** requires a readable log file path as the first argument. Use `/var/log/syslog` on Ubuntu or `/var/log/messages` on CentOS.
- **Script 5** is interactive — it will prompt for input when run.
- **No root/sudo access** is required to run any script.
